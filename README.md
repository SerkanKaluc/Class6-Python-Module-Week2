## 1. Write a Python program which executes following rules on this given list => numbers = [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19]
	-take an input(number) from the user
	-take out the first element of the list and put it at the end. Do this x times that in the first step the user indicated.
	-print the list
	-(OPTIONAL) make sure there is not an error while taking input

## 2. Write a Python program that returns the following dictionary with sorted values. NOTE: Dictonaries have keys and values. Here the values are lists. So, the returned dictonary should have sorted values(list)

data = {
    'a': [5, 3, 9, 0, 2, 3, 1],
    'b': [4, 7, 5, 1, 2],
    'c': [8, 1, 3, 2, 4]
}

## 3. Write a Python program that returns a dictionary which consists the unique elements in the following tuple as keys and the number of occurrences of elements as values.

tuple1 = (20, 10, 60, 70, 50, 20, 80, 20, 10, 20, 60, 60, 50)
